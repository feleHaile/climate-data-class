ATS 301 Climate Data Anlysis class

The labs are distributed as PDF's of the notebooks (without the output, and with some "folded" cells), to enourage students to type in the code themselves.  (Some students do cut-and-paste from the PDF, but this often causes issues with non-printing characters and the like.)

I use the codefolding nbextension (from jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) to hide code in certain "answer" cells.  These cells often start with a lone "#" in the first line of the cell, though sometimes there is a basic instruction in the first line comment.  In this way, I can step through the lab with students and show them the result they should get w/o showing them the code.

I am willing to share lecture slides as well; however, I can't confirm that all of the images have copyrights such that I can share them.  Feel free to contact me if you would like slides.  I also have reading quizzes and homework answer keys (currently sort of messy).

You'll see I diverged a bit from the schedule.  In particular, the lab numbering differs, especially near the end of the course.
