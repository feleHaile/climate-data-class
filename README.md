ATS 301 Climate Data Anlysis class

The labs are distributed as PDF's of the notebooks (without the output, and with some "folded" cells), to enourage students to type in the code themselves.  (Some students do cut-and-paste from the PDF, but this often causes issues with non-printing characters and the like.)

I use the codefolding nbextension (from jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) to hide code in certain "answer" cells.  These cells often start with a lone "#" in the first line of the cell, though sometimes there is a basic instruction in the first line comment.  In this way, I can step through the lab with students and show them the result they should get w/o showing them the code.
